# Comprehensive Linguistic Framework for Constructing Artificial Languages

> A synthesis of linguistic theory tailored for software that designs, evolves, and validates constructed languages (conlangs). Organized for direct implementation with clear data models, constraints, and test harnesses.

---

## 0) Scope & Design Principles

- **Audience:** language engineers, conlangers, and tool builders.
- **Goals:** (1) cover core linguistic systems; (2) offer typological guardrails; (3) specify data structures and algorithms; (4) provide QA/test cases; (5) support both naturalistic and innovative conlangs.
- **Architecture:** modular (phonology ⇄ morphology ⇄ syntax ⇄ semantics ⇄ orthography), with cross‑links and shared feature systems; diachronic module for sound change and grammaticalization; sociolinguistic overlays for register/dialect.

---

## 1) Phonological Foundation

### 1.1 Sound Systems & Inventories

**Representations**
- **Segment inventory:** store IPA symbol, type (C/V), and feature vector (binary/privative). Suggested feature sets:
    - Consonants: {place, manner, voice, nasality, laterality, sibilant, aspiration, secondary articulation (palatalization, labialization, velarization), airstream (pulmonic/ejective/click)}.
    - Vowels: {height, backness, rounding, tenseness/length, nasality, advanced tongue root, phonation (modal/breathy/creaky)}.
- **Distinctive features:** canonical matrix; define natural classes by feature queries.

**Typological guidance (high level)**
- Typical consonant inventory size ≈ 20–25; extremes exist (very small to very large).
- Common vowel systems: 3, 5, and 7 quality sets; 5‑vowel /a e i o u/ is especially frequent.
- Permit rare choices (e.g., no /a/) but flag them for awareness.

**Phonotactics**
- Syllable templates as regex/FSAs: e.g., `(C)(C)V(C)`; per‑slot allowlists/banlists (e.g., no /ŋ/ in onset).
- Cluster constraints by sonority sequencing and language‑specific exceptions.
- Vowel sequences: diphthongs vs hiatus policies; syllabification algorithm.

**Allophony & Morphophonology**
- Rule format: `/X/ → [Y] / L__R (prosodic position, stress)`; priorities/ordering; rule classes (sandhi, lenition, assimilation, harmony).
- Allomorphy binding:
    - contextual (phonological environment),
    - morphosyntactic (e.g., case‑specific forms),
    - lexical (irregular stems).

**Suprasegmentals**
- **Stress:** fixed (initial/penult/final), weight‑sensitive, lexical.
- **Tone:** level vs contour; register vs lexical tone; association at mora/syllable; tone spreading and sandhi.
- **Pitch accent:** single accent per word or per prosodic word.

#### Software specifications
- Data: `Phoneme(id, ipa, features)`, `FeatureSchema`, `PhonotacticRule`, `AllophoneRule`, `SuprasegmentalRule`.
- Generators: FSA for syllables/words; sampler honoring frequencies and constraints.
- Validators:
    - feature integrity (no undefined features),
    - phonotactic compliance (reject illegal clusters),
    - coverage checks (e.g., every vowel has tone if tonal systems require it).

#### Test cases
- Generate N=10k syllables; assert all match templates.
- Apply rule suite to minimal pairs; verify target outcomes (e.g., /n/→[m] before bilabials).
- Stress assignment over polysyllables; confirm weight sensitivity.

### 1.2 Phonological Processes

- **Assimilation/dissimilation:** place/voice/nasal harmony; vowel harmony (backness/rounding/ATR).
- **Epenthesis/deletion:** hiatus breakers; coda repair; syncope/aphesis/apocope.
- **Metathesis:** constrained swap patterns.
- **Lenition/fortition:** positionally conditioned (intervocalic, coda, onset).
- **Chain shifts:** ordered rules (e.g., k→t͡ʃ before front vowels; then t͡ʃ→ʃ / __#).
- **Prosody:** tone sandhi; boundary‑level resyllabification.

#### Software specifications
- Ordered rewrite engine with environment matchers over feature sets; supports parallel strata when needed.
- Derivation traces (debug view) from underlying → surface forms.

#### Test cases
- Golden files for derivations; property tests assuring closure under inventory (no out‑of‑inventory phones unless flagged asophones).

---

## 2) Morphological Architecture

### 2.1 Word Formation Systems

- **Inflection vs derivation:** separate namespaces; derivation may change lexical category; inflection realizes morphosyntactic features.
- **Typology sliders:**
    - **Synthesis:** isolating ⇄ polysynthetic (avg morphemes/word).
    - **Fusion:** agglutinative ⇄ fusional (one‑to‑one vs bundled features).
- **Affixation:** prefixes/suffixes/infixes/circumfixes; slot templates and ordering constraints.
- **Non‑concatenative:** root‑template (consonantal roots + vocalic patterns), ablaut, reduplication (full/partial, prosodic templates), suppletion.
- **Compounding:** head direction, linking morphemes, stress rules, semantic transparency flags.
- **Productivity:** per‑morpheme productivity score; lexicalization flags.

### 2.2 Grammatical Categories

**Nominal**
- Number (sg/pl/dual/trial/paucal), gender/noun classes (sex‑based; animacy; semantic classes), case (core/oblique sets), definiteness, classifiers, possession types (alienable/inalienable).

**Verbal**
- Person (incl/excl), number, gender agreement; tense (past/non‑past… remote distinctions), aspect (perf/imperf; prog/hab), mood (indicative/subjunctive/imperative/conditional/optative), polarity, voice (active/passive/middle/antipassive/applicative/causative), evidentiality, mirativity, switch‑reference.

**Cross‑categorical**
- Deixis (spatial/temporal), politeness/honorific levels, polarity/negation strategies, focus/topic marking.

#### Software specifications
- Data: `Feature` & `Value` registries; `Morpheme(form, exponence={feature:value…}, conditions)`; `Template` with ordered slots.
- Realization:
    - selection by unification (target feature bundle ↔ morpheme exponence),
    - allomorphy selectors (phonological, morphosyntactic, lexical),
    - conflict resolver (syncretism allowed, conflicts flagged).
- Paradigm engine: generate full tables; detect gaps and syncretisms; export IGT (interlinear glossed text) labels.

#### Test cases
- Conjugation/declension grids for sample lexemes; assert completeness.
- Allomorph choice under harmony; verify correct variant selection.
- Derivation pipelines (root → derived POS); ensure category changes and semantics recorded.

---

## 3) Syntactic Structures

### 3.1 Clause Architecture

- **Basic word order:** SOV/SVO/VSO/VOS/OVS/OSV; allow flexible/pragmatic order with constraints.
- **Constituents:** NP/VP/PP/AP; head directionality per phrase type.
- **Argument structure:** verb valency frames; theta roles (agent/patient/experiencer/goal/source/beneficiary…); valency operations (passive/antipassive/applicative/causative/middle).
- **Alignment:** nominative‑accusative; ergative‑absolutive; split (by TAM/person/noun type); active‑stative.
- **Case assignment & agreement:** mapping from roles to cases; agreement targets (verb/adjective/particles).

### 3.2 Complex Constructions

- **Coordination:** conjunctions vs asyndetic; agreement/ellipsis rules.
- **Subordination:** complementizers, converbs/participles, control/raising; clause chaining.
- **Relative clauses:** position (pre‑/post‑nominal), strategies (pronoun/particle/gap/resumptive), accessibility hierarchy.
- **Interrogatives:** yes/no (intonation/particles/inversion), content questions (wh‑fronting vs in‑situ), multiple wh policies.
- **Focus/Topic:** particles, clefts, movement windows, prosodic cues.
- **Serial verb constructions:** argument sharing; TAM distribution.
- **Negation:** particles/affixes; scope rules; negative concord.

#### Software specifications
- Grammar as parametric **phrase‑structure** or **dependency** rules with feature unification.
- Linearization engine uses head direction + movement operations + prosody hooks.
- Interface to morphology for agreement and case realization; to phonology for sandhi across words.

#### Test cases
- Generate canonical transitive/intransitive/ditransitive sentences (affirmative/negative/interrogative) with IGT.
- Relative and embedded clauses with variable extraction sites; verify constraints.
- Voice alternations: active ↔ passive/antipassive; check role remapping.

---

## 4) Semantic Frameworks

### 4.1 Lexical Semantics

- **Semantic fields:** color, kinship, body parts, motion, spatial relations; culture‑specific domains.
- **Sense structure:** polysemy networks; homonymy; metaphor/metonymy links; lexical gap tracking.
- **Frames & roles:** VerbNet/FrameNet‑style frames for common predicates; alternations (dative/locative, causative/inchoative).
- **Classifier systems & measure terms:** numeral classifier inventories with selection constraints.

### 4.2 Compositional Semantics

- **Feature semantics:** morphosyntactic features update semantic representation (TAM, polarity, evidentiality).
- **Argument mapping:** predicate‑argument structures; scope and quantification strategies; disambiguation options.
- **Pragmatics:** implicature‑bearing particles; register tags; politeness strategies; information‑structure integration.

#### Software specifications
- Lightweight semantic graph (predicate nodes, role edges, feature annotations); optional logical forms.
- Lexicon entries link to frames/senses; idiom lists with non‑compositional mappings.

#### Test cases
- Scope ambiguity pack: generate two readings with explicit markers when available.
- Idiom realization vs literal compositional output; ensure correct mapping.

---

## 5) Writing System Considerations

- **Script types:** alphabet, abjad, abugida, syllabary, logography, mixed.
- **Directionality:** LTR/RTL/vertical; punctuation conventions.
- **Orthographic depth:** shallow (phonemic) to deep (historical); grapheme‑to‑phoneme rules; digraph handling.
- **Tone/diacritics:** placement rules; optional vs mandatory marking.
- **Transliteration & romanization:** reversible mappings; export pipelines.

#### Software specifications
- `GraphemeMap`: phoneme/syllable/morpheme → glyph(s); rendering pipeline with contextual forms when needed.
- Transliterator stages: surface phonology → orthography; optional alternative orthographies.

#### Test cases
- Round‑trip tests: phoneme sequence → script → transliteration → phoneme sequence (within tolerance).
- Script charts autogenerated from mapping tables.

---

## 6) Sociolinguistic Variables

- **Variation:** regional dialects, sociolects, idiolects; phonological/lexical/grammatical profiles per variety.
- **Register & genre:** formal/informal, ritual/poetic/legal; style constraints and alternations.
- **Language contact:** borrowing pipelines; code‑switching policies; loanword adaptation rules.
- **Diglossia:** H/L varieties; domain allocation; morphosyntactic divergences.

#### Software specifications
- Variant overlays: per‑dialect rule deltas (phonology/morphology/syntax/lexicon) with precedence chain.
- Borrowing module: donor → recipient adaptation (phoneme substitution, morphology integration).

#### Test cases
- Same proposition across two registers/dialects; compare outputs.
- Loanword intake: donor form → adapted recipient form via rules.

---

## 7) Psycholinguistic Constraints

- **Articulation & perception:** penalize extreme cluster densities or minimal contrasts if desired.
- **Acquisition:** overregularization pathways; frequency effects; irregular core items.
- **Processing limits:** center‑embedding thresholds; ambiguity resolution strategies; redundancy.

#### Software specifications
- Heuristics scoring “learnability” and “processability” (informative, not prescriptive).
- Optional simplification suggestions (e.g., analogical leveling) flagged in reports.

#### Test cases
- Complexity metrics over generated corpus (average morphemes/word, parse ambiguity count, homophony rate).

---

## 8) Historical & Comparative Dimensions

- **Sound change:** ordered rules; conditioned/unconditioned; chain shifts; merger/split accounting.
- **Morphosyntactic change:** cliticization → affixation; grammaticalization pathways; alignment shifts.
- **Lexical change:** replacement rates; taboo cycles; semantic drift (broadening/narrowing/amelioration/pejoration).
- **Families & dialect continua:** protoforms; cognate sets; correspondence tables; areal features.

#### Software specifications
- Diachronic pipeline: Proto lexicon + change set → Daughter(s); track derivations and reflexes.
- Family model: tree topology; shared innovations; automated cognate tables; export comparative wordlists.

#### Test cases
- Apply change set to 1k‑word proto list; validate regularity (no stray exceptions unless marked as loans/analogy).
- Reconstructibility smoke tests: consistent correspondences across daughters.

## 9) Implementation Guidelines for Tool Builders

### 9.1 Data Structures (suggested)

- `Language`: refs to modules; metadata (name, era, family, typological profile).
- `Phonology`: phonemes, features, phonotactics, rules, suprasegmentals.
- `Morphology`: features/values, morphemes, templates, paradigms, allomorphy.
- `Syntax`: parameter set (word order, head direction), rule set (PSG/dep), movement/linearization.
- `Semantics`: frames, roles, sense inventory, idioms.
- `Orthography`: grapheme map(s), transliteration schemes.
- `Lexicon`: entries (lemma, POS, phonology, semantics, features, irregulars, etymology, register/dialect tags).
- `Diachrony`: change sets, family graph, proto/daughter link tables.

Store as JSON/YAML with schemas; or relational (tables for phonemes, morphemes, rules, lexemes, etc.). Ensure referential integrity and versioning.

### 9.2 Algorithms

- **Generators:** syllable/word (FSA), paradigm builder (unification), sentence linearizer (rule‑driven), orthography renderer.
- **Rule engines:** ordered rewrite for phonology/diachrony; constraint satisfaction for morphotactics; unification for agreement/case.
- **Analyzers:** parser for IGT; morphological analyzer (FSTs helpful); dialect diffs.
- **Samplers:** frequency‑aware lexeme suggestion; typology‑constrained randomizer with plausibility scores.

### 9.3 UI/UX Workflow

1) **Phonology** → 2) **Morphology** → 3) **Syntax** → 4) **Semantics** → 5) **Orthography** → 6) **Lexicon** → 7) **Sociolinguistics** → 8) **Diachrony** → 9) **QA & Export**.

- Wizards + expert mode. Visuals: IPA grid; paradigm tables; dependency trees; family trees; script charts.
- Inline validators & “typology tips” (inform, not block).

### 9.4 Computational Challenges & Mitigations

- Non‑concatenative morphology → template merger engine; cache compiled patterns.
- Tone & sandhi → multi‑tier representations; late‑stage phonology pass over phrase.
- Orthography rendering → fallback romanization; PUA/embedded fonts for custom scripts.
- Scale → memoization; incremental recomputation; chunked batch processing for diachrony.
- Exceptions → per‑lexeme overrides; precedence rules; diagnostics when rules conflict.

---

## 10) Deliverables & QA

### 10.1 Standard Outputs

- **Language Report (Markdown/PDF/HTML)** with sections matching this framework.
- **Lexicon exports** (CSV/TSV/LMF‑like), with etymology, register, dialect tags.
- **Grammar artifacts**: PSG/dep rules, paradigms, IGT examples, orthography charts.
- **Family artifacts**: proto tables, sound changes, cognate lists, tree diagrams.

### 10.2 Validation Suite

- Unit tests per module (phonotactics, rules, paradigms, syntax transforms).
- Property tests (e.g., no illegal syllables; agreement always resolves; no stranded tones).
- Corpus checks: homophony rates, parse ambiguity counts, average word/morpheme stats.
- Regression tests for diachronic pipelines (stable outputs across versions).

### 10.3 Typological Guardrails (advisory)

- Flag uncommon combinations (e.g., extreme consonant clusters + no vowels marked; OSV + rigid prepositions) without blocking.
- Offer presets mirroring common profiles (e.g., 5‑vowel system; SOV+postpositions; SVO+prepositions; inclusive/exclusive pronouns; noun‑class systems; tone vs stress).
